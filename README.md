# -Bluetooth-controlled-car
For this project, the team was provided with a model car that moved by action of a pair of motorized wheels and was controlled by an arduino board. The goal was to use Matlab to model a classroom and, through the use of trajectory generation algorithms, define a viable path for the car to follow while moving from point A to point B and avoiding obstacles, where the movement was generated by applying dynamic models to calculate speed and direction data for each motor and sending it to the microcontroller via bluetooth.

# What I did
1. I was in charge of implementing the PRM algorithm to generate a trajectory between 2 points in a map by generating a point could and finding the most efficent way of connecting them in terms of how they contribute in getting closer to the goal point.
2. I applied the dynamic models of the car in order to find the necessary speed and direction values of each wheel for the car to follow the points set in the path.
3. I stablished the connection between Matlab and the Arduino board through the bluetooth module and implemented code for the data emission and reception to be in sync and allow for the movement to be generated correctly.
